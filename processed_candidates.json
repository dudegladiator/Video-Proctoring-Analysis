Key indicators include multiple instances of 'Window change detected' (8 times) and 'No face detected' (22 times) spread throughout the exam, not just within the first or last 5 minutes. The 'Window change detected' events are particularly concerning as they occur in clusters and are combined with 'No face detected' instances, which strongly suggests attempts to look up information or use unauthorized resources. Additionally, the 'Browser window swapped' activity adds to the suspicion.
